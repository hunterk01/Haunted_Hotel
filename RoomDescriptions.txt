<INTRO>
<LongDesc>
You're driving over a mountain pass, on your way to visit family.  Trees fly by
on either side as you speed down the road. The smell of pine blows in through
your open window.  'What a beautiful spring day for a drive', you think to 
yourself. Suddenly, a dark shadow passes over the car, as if a storm was rolling
in. You look out the window, but there isn't a cloud in the sky. A feeling on
unease overcomes you at the strangeness of the occurrence. You drive on into the
growing gloom.

After traveling another mile down the road, your car engine starts to sputter.
You look at the gas gauge and see the needle pointing at empty.  You find that
alarming, since you just filled up before heading up the pass.  It shouldn't be
anywhere near empty.  As you round a turn, you see a hotel up ahead. Your engine
sputters to a halt as your car rolls up to the front of the hotel. You decide to
go inside and try to get some help.

<LOBBY>
<LongDesc:Test>
Location: Lobby

You enter the dusty hotel lobby.  Dim light from the windows cast shadows across
the empty room.  The doors slam shut behind you and you hear the lock latch.  You

<FDESK>
<LongDesc>
Location: Front Desk

You stand before an ornate front desk made of cherry wood, but there's no one in
sight to help you.  Rows of room keys hang from small hooks on the wall behind it.
A dusty, old guest book lies on the desk.  A bell sits next to it. The lobby is 
to the south and an elevator is to the West.

<GUESTBOOK>
<LongDesc>
Location: Front Desk

The sound of the bell echoes through the room.  You hear the strain of creaking
leather as the old guest book starts to open by itself. A pen rolls across the
desk, coming to a stop next to the book. You scan the list of names on the page,
ending in a blank line awaiting a signature. The lobby is to the South and an
elevator is to the West.

Exits: South, West
<End>

<ShortDesc>
Location: Front Desk

As you sign your name in the book and set the pen down, you hear the jangling of

the tag.  The lobby is to the south and an elevator is to the West.

You are standing in the hotel's elevator.  It looks to have been fancy at one
time, but time has not been kind to it.  The fabric on the walls is now torn and
faded, and the once shiny metal, now left dull and scratched.  There are four
buttons on the control panel.  Numbers 1, 2, and 3 for the top floors and B for
the basement.  The basement button also has a slot next to it for a key.

Press 1 for first floor, 2 for  second, 3 for  third, and B for basement.

<RECORD>
<LongDesc>
You start the record player and the sound of a waltz echoes through the ballroom.
You turn around and see that numerous ghostly couples are dancing circles around
the room.  Your amazement turns to horror as you realize that all of the couples
are hanging limp, being moved about by ghostly strings, like marionettes.  You
notice another ghost, dressed in maintenance worker clothes, standing on the far
side of the room.  He is smiling, apparently amused by the spectacle.  As the
song comes to an end, all of the spirits fade away, leaving you alone in the
ballroom.  You feel a chill down your spine as you think about the scene you
just witnessed.

Location: Room 237

You unlock the door and enter the room.  You find it surprisingly clean and it
looks as if someone has stayed in here recently.  You are overcome with a
feeling of drowsiness and you feel like lying down for a while.  As you sit
down on the bed, you hear the whisper of a female voice say, 'No, you must not
stay here.'

'Why not?  What will happen?' you speak to an empty room.

'I cannot say more, or he will know that I am helping you' the voice replies.
'Come find me and I will explain all.  I am in the garden, at the fountain.'

The drowsiness fades and you get the feeling that you should leave this room
fast.

These books seem to be about different occult rituals that can be performed.
You pick up one of the books and read a chapter on performing human sacrifice
to obtain life after death.  As you flip to the next chapter, the book is torn
from your hands and slammed back down on the stack of books.  Startled, you
look around, but no one is there.

'Leave my things alone!' a disembodied voice shouts.  

In a panic, you stumble out of the room and back into the hallway.  

'...and stay out!' the voice shouts as the door slams shut.

Light from the small, dirty windows barely illuminates the basement.  The

"Your life is in danger.  Long ago a maintenance man who worked here committed
murder at this hotel.  I was his first victim and my soul has been trapped here
ever since.  Over the years, I watched his many atrocities as he grew more evil,
eventually practicing dark rituals of the occult.  He built this chamber, so he
could do so in secrecy.  I have watched countless people suffer at his hands.

He eventually grew very ill and died, but his spirit lingered on to haunt these
grounds.  Due to his practice of the occult, he was able to continue with his
killing, even after becoming a ghost himself.

When the hotel went out of business, he still found a way to continue.  He lures
travelers into the hotel, trapping them here.  When they eventually sleep, he is
able to enter their souls and make them his.  He then forces them to take their
own lives.  Many people have died this way, but you might be the first to escape
this fate.  A chamber lies beyond this room, where you will find what you need
to leave this place. The ghost points to a specific brick in the wall.

Press this and it will open the way.  Find what he holds and use it to escape.
Tell others of this place, so that it can be cleansed of his evil.  Maybe then
I can be free of this madness.  Hurry, you do not have much time."

The ghost fades away and leaves you alone in the room.

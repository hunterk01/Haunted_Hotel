<INTRO>
<LongDesc>
You're driving over a mountain pass, on your way to visit family.  Trees fly by on either 
side as you speed down the road. The smell of pine blows in through your open window.  
'What a beautiful spring day for a drive', you think to yourself. Suddenly, a dark shadow 
passes over the car, as if a storm was rolling in. You look out the window, but there 
isn't a cloud in the sky. A feeling on unease overcomes you at the strangeness of the 
occurrence. You drive on into the growing gloom.

After traveling another mile down the road, your car engine starts to sputter.  You look 
at the gas gauge and see the needle pointing at empty.  You find that alarming, since you 
just filled up before heading up the pass.  It shouldn't be anywhere near empty.  As you 
round a turn, you see a hotel up ahead. Your engine sputters to a halt as your car rolls 
up to the front of the hotel. You decide to go inside and try to get some help.

Location: Hotel Front Door

You are standing in front of a weather beaten hotel.  Large double doors stand before 
you, the wood cracked from years of neglect. The sign above the door says, Welcome to the 
Chesterfield Hotel.

Entrance: North
<End>

<LOBBY>
<LongDesc>
Location: Lobby

You enter the dusty hotel lobby.  Dim light from the windows cast shadows across the 
empty room.  The doors slam shut behind you and you hear the lock latch.  You try to open 
the door, but it won't budge.  The hotel's front desk is to the north. There are doorways 
to both the East and West.

Exits: North, East, West

<FDESK>
<LongDesc>
Location: Front Desk

You stand before an ornate front desk made of cherry wood, but there's no one in sight to 
help you.  Rows of room keys hang from small hooks on the wall behind it. A dusty, old 
guest book lies on the desk.  A bell sits next to it. The lobby is to the south and an 
elevator is to the West.

Exits: South, West
<End>

<ShortDesc>
Location: Front Desk

You stand at the hotel's front desk.  Rows of room keys hang from small hooks on the wall 
behind it.  One of them are missing. The guest book lies open on the desktop.  Your name 
is signed on the bottom line.  The lobby is to the south and an elevator is to the West.

Exits: South, West
<End>

<GUESTBOOK>
<LongDesc>
Location: Front Desk

The sound of the bell echoes through the room.  You hear the strain of creaking leather 
as the old guest book starts to open by itself. A pen rolls across the desk, coming to a 
stop next to the book. You scan the list of names on the page, ending in a blank line 
awaiting a signature. The lobby is to the South and an elevator is to the West.

Exits: South, West
<End>

<ShortDesc>
Location: Front Desk

As you sign your name in the book and set the pen down, you hear the jangling of keys.  
You look up to see a room key rise up off its hook and float toward you.  You hold out 
your hand and it comes to rest in your palm.  It says Room 237 on the tag.  The lobby is 
to the south and an elevator is to the West.

Exits: South, West

<ELEV1X>
<LongDesc>
Location: Elevator 1F

You're standing at the elevator door.  Looking at the dial above the door, you see that 
there are three floors and a basement in this hotel.  As abandoned and rundown as this 
place looks.  You're not sure if it will even work.  Only one way to find out.

Exits: East

<LongDesc>
Location: Elevator Interior

You are standing in the hotel's elevator.  It looks to have been fancy at one time, but 
time has not been kind to it.  The fabric on the walls is now torn and faded, and the 
once shiny metal, now left dull and scratched.  There are four buttons on the control 
panel.  Numbers 1, 2, and 3 for the top floors and B for the basement.  The basement 
button also has a slot next to it for a key.

Press 1 for the first floor, 2 for the second, 3 for the third, and B for the basement.

<DINING>
<LongDesc>
Location: Dining Room

This dining room must have been beautiful at one time, but now it's a mess of dusty 
tables and overturned chairs.  The wreck of a huge crystal chandelier lies shattered on 
the floor in the center of the room.  There are doors leading to the North and East.

<KITCHEN>
<LongDesc>
Location: Kitchen

You're in the kitchen.  The smell of rotten food is overwhelming!  The sink is filled 
with dirty water.  Pots, pans and kitchen utensils are haphazardly spread across the 
floor.  Rows of cabinets line the walls.  The only exit is to the South.

Exits: South
<End>
Location: Kitchen

The kitchen is foul smelling and messy.  It obviously hasn't been used in years.  There's 
nothing of use here any longer.  The exit is to the South.

<BALLROOM>
<LongDesc>
Location: Ballroom

You're in a grand ballroom.  These hardwood floors have undoubtedly seen many guests 
dancing late into the evening.  An old record player sits in the corner of the room. 
There are doors to the North and West.

Exits: North, West

<RECORD>
<LongDesc>
You start the record player and the sound of a waltz echoes through the ballroom.  You 
turn around and see that numerous ghostly couples are dancing circles around the room.  
Your amazement turns to horror as you realize that all of the couples are hanging limp, 
being moved about by ghostly strings, like marionettes.  You notice another ghost, 
dressed in maintenance worker clothes, standing on the far side of the room.  He is 
smiling, apparently amused by the spectacle.  As the song comes to an end, all of the 
spirits fade away, leaving you alone in the ballroom.  You feel a chill down your spine 
as you think about the scene you just witnessed.

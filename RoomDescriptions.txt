Introduction

You're driving over a mountain pass, on your way to visit family.  Trees fly by
on either side as you speed down the road. The smell of pine blows in through
your open window.  'What a beautiful spring day for a drive', you think to 
yourself. Suddenly, a dark shadow passes over the car, as if a storm was 
rolling in. You look out the window, but there isn't a cloud in the sky. A 
feeling on unease overcomes you at the strangeness of the occurrence. You drive
on into the growing gloom.

After traveling another mile down the road, your car engine starts to sputter.
You look at the gas gauge and see the needle pointing at empty.  You find that
alarming, since you just filled up before heading up the pass.  It shouldn't be
anywhere near empty.  As you round a turn, you see a hotel up ahead. Your 
engine sputters to a halt as your car rolls up to the front of the hotel. You 
decide to go inside and try to get some help.

RECORD
<FirstDesc>
You start the record player and the sound of a waltz echoes through the 
ballroom.  You turn around and see that numerous ghostly couples are dancing 
circles around the room.  Your amazement turns to horror as you realize that 
all of the couples are hanging limp, being moved about by ghostly strings, like
marionettes.  You notice another ghost, dressed in maintenance worker clothes,
standing on the far side of the room.  He is smiling, apparently amused by the
spectacle.

As the song comes to an end, the spirits stop dancing and move toward the North
door as if to adjourn outside to cool off.  They all pass through the door, out
of sight.  As the last of the dancers passes through, you hear a clicking sound
as the lock on the door unlatches.

You notice that the ghost of the maintenance worker has not left with the 
others.  His earlier look of pleasure has changed to one of anger as he glares
at the now unlocked door.  He lets out a scream of rage and fades out of sight.
You feel a chill run down your spine as you think about the scene you just 
witnessed.

feeling of drowsiness and you feel like lying down for a while.  As you sit
down on the bed, you hear the whisper of a female voice say, 'No, you must not
stay here.'

'Why not?  What will happen?' you speak to an empty room.

'I cannot say more, or he will know that I am helping you' the voice replies.
'Come find me and I will explain all.  I am in the garden, at the fountain.'

The drowsiness fades and you get the feeling that you should leave this room
fast.

surrounded by strange markings on the floor.  You pick up the book and see
that this image is about a ritual performed to acheive life after death.

Before you can read any further, the book is ripped from your hands.  Startled,
you look around, but no one is there.  The book floats in the air before a
moment longer, then slams back down on the nighstand.

'Leave my things alone!' a disembodied voice shouts.  

In a panic, you stumble out of the room and back into the hallway.  

'...and stay out!' the voice shouts as the door slams shut.

"Your life is in danger.  Long ago a maintenance man who worked here committed
murder at this hotel.  I was his first victim and my soul has been trapped here
ever since.  Over the years, I watched his many atrocities as he grew more 
evil, eventually practicing dark rituals of the occult.  He built this chamber,
so he could do so in secrecy.  I have watched countless people suffer at his 
hands.

He eventually grew very ill and died, but his spirit lingered on to haunt these
grounds.  Due to his practice of the occult, he was able to continue with his
killing, even after becoming a ghost himself.

When the hotel went out of business, he still found a way to continue.  He 
lures travelers into the hotel, trapping them here.  When they eventually 
sleep, he is able to enter their souls and make them his.  He peforms a ritual
in this room that allows him to rip their souls from their bodies.  Many people
have died this way, but you might be the first to escape this fate.  A chamber
lies beyond this room, where you will find what you need to leave this place. 
The ghost points to a specific brick in the wall.

Press this and it will open the way.  Find what he holds and use it to escape.
Tell others of this place, so that it can be cleansed of his evil.  Maybe then
I can be free of this madness.  Hurry, you do not have much time."

The ghost fades away and leaves you alone in the room.

glow an eerie green color.  You try to stand, but can't move your body.

The spirit of the maintenance man appears before you.

"It's no use struggling" he says.  "You are mine now."

He reaches down, plunging his hand into your chest.  You scream in pain as
you feel your soul being ripped from your body.  You are lost in excruciating
pain and a blur of motion.  When it finally subsides, you are looking down at
your dead body.

"You belong to me now" the maintenance man says.  "Go up and join the others."

He gestures to the stairs and you feel compelled to obey.  You go up the stairs
into the garden and are surrounded by many other miserable looking ghosts.
The woman who tried to help you stands in front of you, with a look of
sadness and dispair on her face.

"Meet your new companions" he says.  "You're going to be with us for a long,
long time."
